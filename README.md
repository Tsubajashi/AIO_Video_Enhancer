# AIO_Video_Enhancer
# [WIP] Video Upscaler / Interpolator AIO
The project is still WIP, and will have bugs.
As of right now, the Project is not in a working state, check out the repo at a later date, and it'll probably work soon.

# What it should be able to do after going out of WIP
You will be able to upscale and interpolate your videos by using waifu2x-ncnn, and rife-ncnn.
I'm currently working on my own AI for Upscaling and Interpolation. When it's done, it'll be implemented here aswell for better Quality and faster Upscaling/Interpolation.

# Dependencies and how to install them
[WIP]
DearPyGui (either from the requirements.txt or with "pip install dearpygui")

# Compatible With:
Windows/Linux/MacOS

# Contributor
Tremeschin (https://tremeschin.gitlab.io/) (Backend)

# Donating
As of right now, there will be no way of donating towards the development of the software.
If you really want to donate though, you can message me on discord (Tsubajashi#8355) and we'll find a way.
At a later date, there probably will be a Paypal or Ko-fi Donation Link, when the software gains more interest.
